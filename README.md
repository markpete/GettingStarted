This Github repository has a set of instructions to get you up and running with GitHub, Visual Code, and Java, so that you can collaborate and start contributing with your team members.\
Please follow the directions below and post on the [Issues page](https://github.com/markpete/GettingStarted/issues) if you run into any problems.  Note that these steps are required whether you work on Windows, MacOS, or Linux.

## 1. Install Visual Code
Visual Code is an IDE that is well-suited to integrate coding, debugging, running tests, and interacting with your Github repository, all from a single interface.  It is also extensible which means that you can install add-ons to perform specific tasks that you may desire such as beautifying your code for easier readability.

## 2. Install Git
*Git* is a command-line tool that lets you control and interact with your Github repository.  While you should seldom need to access this tool directly, Visual Code will run it in the background for you to interact with your repo.

## 3. Configure Visual Code for Java
Visual Code is designed to be used as an IDE for many different coding languages.  Since you'll be using it with Java there are a few more steps that you'll need to do.  Luckily the Visual Code team has this well-documented.
#### [Steps for Configuring Visual Code for Java](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-tutorial)
Note that the MOST important step here is installing Java.  If you already have it, you can skip that step, but you'll still need to do the configuration.  I recommend [Oracle Java SE 14 SDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

## 4. Working with Github from Visual Code
You're now ready to learn how to "clone" a repository, "fork" your code, and submit edits to the repo, all from within Visual Code.
#### [Working with Github](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github)
Some terminology here:
- *Repostiory* - This is the location in Github where your source code project is stored.  Also, known as "Cloud" or "Remote" repository.
- *Local Repository* - This is your copy of the repository that you have stored on your local hard drive after you "clone" it.
- *Clone* - Creates a copy of the remote repository on your hard drive which includes all uncommitted code branches.
- *Branch* - You should never work directly on the main or root branch.  Instead create a personal branch for you to work in, that will make it easier when you submit it later for others to code review and then merge your branch back into the main branch.
- *Pull Request* - When you are ready to submit your code back to the server, you can create a pull request.  It contains all of the current changes in your branch.  Others can code review your pull request and offer feedback or suggestions for improvements.
- *Code Review* - When a partner submits their pull request, you may be asked to code review it.  You should consider the code and offer feedback, cite bugs, or provide suggestions.  You can also track any issues your find in the Issues list.
- *Issues* - Think of this as your work tracker.  This is a list that can include bugs as well as work assignments for your group members.

## 5. Get to know the Visual Code Documentation Site
There are many other capabilities in Visual Code that you'll want to learn about over time.  In addition the VS Code team issues updates with new features almost monthly.  Not to worry, your copy of Visual Studio Code will allow you to automatically update as those changes come out.
